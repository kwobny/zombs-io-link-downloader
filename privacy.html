            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>ZOMBS.io is a technology company focused on delivering knowledge through vivid, contextually-rich presentations, called ZOMBS.io Visualizations. These ZOMBS.io Visualizations put data into context for researchers, journalists and enterprise.

This Privacy Policy may be updated by us from time to time in which case we will provide notice of material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notification on the ZOMBS.io website.</p>
            <p><strong>Notice and Choice</strong></p>
            <p>We collect Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, and Public Information.</p>
            <p>We collect Personal Information when you provide it to us, for example by creating an account. We may ask for your email address if you wish to be notified when listings have changed, for confirmation emails, authenticating your account, accounting notices and other reasons including instances in which you have requested specific information or updates.</p>
            <p>If you use Facebook or Google to create an account on any of our network sites, we will receive information such as your name and email address, as well as other information you may provide to us through those services. These companies may also receive certain data as described in their privacy policies.</p>

However we do provide Personal Information to our vendors or others who are acting to fulfill the services we provide. For example, servers we use to host our website and store information may be managed by other vendors in order to make our site more reliable.</p>
            <p>We collect Public Information when you provide it to us for public display or when we assemble information from publicly accessible databases in order to help you find services or conduct research. For example, some listings ask for, require or include names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other personally identifiable information. This information is optional and is intended to benefit you, your business, or the item listed to assist with promotion or display. If you post information in reviews, or make edits to a listing, please be aware that you have made this information public.</p>
            <p>Please do not post any Personal Information on listings that you wish to keep private. If you have provided us with information that you wish to remove you may edit that listing or contact us directly to remove that information.

            <p>We and our vendors use cookies, web beacons, advertising identifiers, and other tracking technologies to understand site usage and to manage our advertising and affiliate relationships. Furthermore, emails we send may contain a web beacon that allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he or she has used a link within an email to visit a website.

These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (not including your name, address, human-readable email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our sites, other websites, and other forms of media, including emails, about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

Email users wishing to disable our email web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Gmail). Please see your email client for more information.</p>
            <p>We do not presently respond to Do Not Track browser settings. See All About Do Not Track for more information.</p>
            <p>If you click on an advertisement or a link to purchase or learn more about a listing you may be directed to a contact form, website or phone number of a third party. Any information you may provide to such third parties will be subject to their Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently received personal information from a person under the age of 13, we will make every attempt to remove that data.</p>

            <p><strong>Third Parties</strong></p>
            <p>We may disclose information about our users if required to do so by law or when such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may also disclose information about our users when we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; respond to claims that any Listing or other content violates the rights of third-parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users, or the general public at large.</p>
